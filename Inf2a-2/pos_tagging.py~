# PART B: POS tagging

from statements import *

# The tagset we shall use is:
# P  A  Ns  Np  Is  Ip  Ts  Tp  BEs  BEp  DOs  DOp  AR  AND  WHO  WHICH  ?

# Tags for words playing a special role in the grammar:

function_words_tags = [('a','AR'), ('an','AR'), ('and','AND'),
     ('is','BEs'), ('are','BEp'), ('does','DOs'), ('do','DOp'), 
     ('who','WHO'), ('which','WHICH'), ('Who','WHO'), ('Which','WHICH'), ('?','?')]
     # upper or lowercase tolerated at start of question.

function_words = [p[0] for p in function_words_tags]

# English nouns with identical plural forms (list courtesy of Wikipedia):

unchanging_plurals = ['bison','buffalo','deer','fish','moose','pike','plankton',
     'salmon','sheep','swine','trout']
